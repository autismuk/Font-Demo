Demo for FontManager / Bitmap String

This is a demo of the FontManager, which does the Font bits, and the Scene Manager, which does the scene bits.

There are six effects, four of which are 'built in' and the other two (pulser and spinner) are a couple of lines of code in a function.

Each is shown as normal text, as curved text (e.g. shaped) and animated (shaped and changing over time).
